# Webpack web template

### Development

1) Install node modules

```bash
npm install
```
2) Run webpack

For local development:
```bash
npm run start
```
Webpack do this for you:
* Automataticaly reload the page when you make any changes
* Display errors and warnings in console(Can be configured differently. There are many options!)
* Saves your time of course!

For production:
```bash
npm run build
```
* Collect your static files in the dist directory.
